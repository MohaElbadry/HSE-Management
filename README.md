> The project focuses on automating health, safety, and environment (HSE) management processes in the workplace. The current manual procedures have led to problems such as frequent accidents and a lack of real-time monitoring and reporting. By implementing an automated system, employees can easily access up-to-date safety guidelines and procedures through their mobile phones. This empowers them to make informed decisions, report incidents in real-time, and stay away from potential risks. Automation enhances overall organizational efficiency by reducing accidents, minimizing disruptions, and providing valuable data for proactive safety measures. The project aims to create a user-friendly solution that prioritizes employee well-being and contributes to a safer working environment.
